          <h2>Reaching a Social Milestone</h2>
          <p><em>- Posted: October 23 2020</em></p>
          <p>
            It&rsquo;s been a long time since I blogged regularly (and when I
            say &ldquo;regularly&rdquo; I mean maybe 10 times before I became
            distracted with something else ;)).
          </p>

          <p>
            With that in mind, I decided to dredge up some of my old blog posts,
            and there was one in particular that I am quite proud of. It dates
            back to 2010 and gives my opinion on social media, and the idea of
            &lsquo;achievements&rsquo;.
          </p>

          <p>I hope you enjoy. (Originally published 2010)</p>

          <p>
            Perhaps you&rsquo;re the owner of a PC, laptop, iPhone, iPad, PDA,
            Blackberry, xBox, cable&#8230;.the list goes on. I say perhaps, but
            it still does not excuse the fact that computers and the internet
            affects everyone on this planet regardless of their situation.
            However, if you do own a device that can connect to the net, then
            you&rsquo;re more than likely involved, to some degree, with social
            media. In some way or another, this phenomenon has, in turn, touched
            the majority of this planet whether they participate or not. With
            the internet being one of the most immediate and effective
            communication networks in the world, it seems the power of social
            networking can not only benefit the user by providing an enriched
            environment for them to &lsquo;work&rsquo; or &lsquo;play&rsquo; in,
            but also benefit others in need through charity raising,
            corporations to market their goods and famous people to become even
            &lsquo;famouser&rsquo;.
          </p>

          <p>
            At the end of the day, websites like Facebook cater for everyday
            people who want to share, shout, watch, or have an opinion, and even
            those that merely want to have a casual conversation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Like any tool in the world, it depends on what type of
            &lsquo;tool&rsquo; is at the brain end of the system for it to do
            what is required of it. With the westernised world moving at an
            increasingly faster pace through the benefits of technology, it
            seems the internet is convenient for us, a plethora of aid in any
            type of situation, something we use when it suits us. However, and
            there will always be many sides to the story, I feel that we are
            merely more complacent through this outcome, and that the world is
            at our fingertips, whenever we want it. I also feel that we are also
            being moulded by the &lsquo;giant marketing beast&rsquo; that
            dominates the internet, and we must be careful what shape we assume
            when we are &lsquo;fully baked&rsquo;.
          </p>

          <p>
            While the majority of social network users are the &lsquo;lesser
            baked&rsquo; generations, there are still more mature people
            utilising the networks. The monikers of Facebook and Twitter are
            standard in nearly anyone&rsquo;s language in the present day, even
            the term &lsquo;hash tag&rsquo; is popping up in popular media. In
            this terribly labeled WEB 2.0 age, many online services are becoming
            somehow intrinsically intertwined with the likes of Facebook and
            Twitter, thus, nearly unwittingly, we&rsquo;re being led to supply
            Facebook with access to all other parts of our virtual DNA. This may
            sound slightly cynical, especially coming from a web devigner
            (I&rsquo;m coining this, as a designer/developer), especially as I
            fully embrace the concept that I so fully despise. If you
            can&rsquo;t beat &rsquo;em, join &rsquo;em, and always stick close
            to the enemy.
          </p>

          <p>
            Whilst there are many arguments for and against the use of social
            media, I want to focus on what seems to be a smaller developing
            facet of the phenomenon &mdash; awards or milestones. I&rsquo;m not
            talking about ceremonial awards, so any thought of a red carpet
            should evaporate. I&rsquo;m talking about awards given to users of
            social networking dependent on their actions within their virtual
            environment.
          </p>

          <p>
            Before social media was around, &lsquo;virtual&rsquo; awards simply
            seemed to start with computer games, like back in the old days, when
            you&rsquo;d reach a predefined milestone e.g. a certain level, a
            certain number of points, you&rsquo;d be awarded with a new,
            devastating weapon, or unlock a hidden bonus level in the game. This
            is a good thing in most people&rsquo;s books and encourages the user
            to play more, starting a vicious circle of gameplay, award,
            gameplay, award and so on towards the ultimate fulfilment of
            completing the game. For many experienced gamers in the world, this
            is perfectly acceptable. It&rsquo;s harmless enough and really is
            the manufacturer&rsquo;s way of saying, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s some
            content in the game that you&rsquo;ve already paid for, but
            you&rsquo;re going to have to put in a little more effort to enjoy
            it all.&rdquo; Fair enough &mdash; that&rsquo;s the general appeal
            of games.
          </p>

          <p>
            Recently, with games evolving at breakneck speed, apps have brought
            gaming out of it&rsquo;s &lsquo;nerd&rsquo; pigeonhole. With apps
            becoming a part of everyday life, gaming changes ever so slightly. I
            think the first change is the affordability of the games. No longer
            do you have to fork out $50+ for a game and expect the earth from
            it. With iDevices for example, games cost, on average, between $1.20
            and $15, therefore I think the expectations on game content is
            reduced. I think the second change is their &lsquo;fingertip
            availability&rsquo; (I&rsquo;m going to coin that phrase), therefore
            enabling a much wider demographic to have much more immediate access
            to games. Personally, I think these factors have made computer games
            more acceptable than ever.
          </p>

          <p>
            I&rsquo;ve been playing a game recently called &lsquo;Tilt To
            Live&rsquo;, on my iPhone which has me completely addicted. The
            premise is you (an arrow) have to navigate away from ever-spawning
            red dots. You can destroy these little nuisances by utilizing a
            number of different weapons. That, in a nutshell is it.
          </p>

            <img src="./imgs/blog_images/blog_4C.png" alt="" />
            <figcaption>
              "Tilt To Live" for the iPhone
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            Whilst being a very simple, but greatly designed game, it was the
            unique award scheme that enticed me. Other games have quickly
            adopted the same tactic, but like the whole game TTL&rsquo;s award
            system seemed very robust.
          </p>

          <p>
            The developers of the game (a two man show), have looked at the
            game, and picked some milestones that the player can reach. Some of
            these are pretty standard, such as getting a certain number of
            points in a combo, using a certain weapon to kill a record number of
            dots. There are also some &lsquo;wooden spoon&rsquo; type awards,
            like lasting less than five seconds (&ldquo;Our Pity&rdquo;), dying
            with an extraordinary amount of red dots on the screen, one you get
            for not moving for more than five seconds (&ldquo;AFK &ldquo;&mdash;
            or Away From Keyboard for all you noobs, yep, I had to look it up
            too!), even one for bouncing between the left and right walls four
            times.
          </p>

          <p>
            The upshot of all this is the fact that while no extra gameplay is
            added through the earning of each individual award, the player has a
            rising total from each award, some being worth ten, twenty points.
            It&rsquo;s hitting certain numbers in this scale that will
            eventually unlock new weapons. Once the weapons are all unlocked,
            there will more than likely be a number of awards still to win.
            These are worth nothing more than the feeling of achievement in
            gaining them.
          </p>

          <p>
            What&rsquo;s this all got to do with social media, I hear my own
            brain ask. Well, in the last few weeks, I&rsquo;ve been looking into
            social media sites with fervour, and at the moment, there seems to
            be increasing attention to awards.
          </p>

          <p>
            I joined a relatively new social community a few weeks ago called
            blip.fm. A sort of mashup of ideas, but a simple breakdown would be
            like Twitter with the ability to attach a song, with the terminology
            of &lsquo;tweeting&rsquo; changed into &lsquo;blipping&rsquo;. The
            song search is incredibly deep, pulling multiple versions of the
            tune from the web, including originals, live performances and any
            covers that have been posted. Therefore after blipping for a while,
            you have a ever-increasing timeline of your favourite songs, or your
            least favourite songs, or whatever takes your fancy. It only a
            couple of years old, but some &lsquo;dj&rsquo;s&rsquo; already have
            over 10,000 listeners.
          </p>

          <p>
            There is another facet of this music sharing site that pertains to
            awards. A panel on the right of the site shows each DJ to have
            picked up a number of &lsquo;badges&rsquo;, each one pertaining to a
            different milestone being reached.
          </p>

          <p>
            I wonder how far this will go? With social media now being endorsed
            by corporate business as a valid promotional tool, it&rsquo;s
            obvious that it&rsquo;s here to stay. I think Andy Warhol was very
            astute in his summation of &rsquo;15 minutes of fame&rsquo; with the
            whole world offered the opportunity now, through media sharing
            &mdash; or sometimes media &lsquo;showing&rsquo; with less of the
            sharing. We all saw early on in the play that some people on social
            media sites are all about the numbers &mdash; the more
            &lsquo;friends&rsquo; you have, well, it&rsquo;s obvious how popular
            you are! Everyone has their own reason to use sites such as
            Facebook, Twitter or youTube whether or not it may be to simply
            gather numbers and make achievements.
          </p>

          <p>
            So, how are the communities of social networking going to cope with
            social award schemes? Will it enhance how communities interact, or
            is it just another gimmick to entice more and more use of the
            applications. Seriously, how will users gain from these awards?
          </p>

          <p>
            What might there be? I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll be as blunt
            as, &lsquo;first 1000 friends gathered&rsquo;, but more along the
            lines of &lsquo;you have friends in more than 20 countries&rsquo;,
            &lsquo;or the promotion of the most events in your area&rsquo;
            &mdash; these sound like useful reasons to be awarded, still
            encouraging good communication and social awareness.
          </p>

          <p>
            If these social milestones creep into sites such as Facebook, it
            would probably be best if they were kept under wraps until they are
            unlocked, instead of just providing a checklist of statuses to gain.
            In this way, they might be a good tool for a better insight into the
            type of person you are. Deeper, rather than shallower.
