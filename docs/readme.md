## **Site Description**

### **PURPOSE**
This portfolio website should deliver information about me which presents me as a Web Development professional targeting employers in the IT industry. It should show creative flair and thoughtful coding, whilst illustrating your personality and accomplishments.

### **FUNCTIONALITY / FEATURES**
- Clean and simple site / minimal text and images, concetrated more on deisgn simplicity and consistency
- Accessibility / 90% pure semantic markup within the HTML keeping in mind accessibility and giving google and other search engines better context when crawling the site
- Accessibility / When developing the mobile nav, a little research shows that alternatives to the hamburger are starting to be preferred, therefore, utilising simple CSS I used semantic icons for the menu items.
- High contrast buttons / Drawing the user's eye to these "Call to Action" buttons
- Muted tones and colours / simple palette and easy on the eye - shades of brown are underrated - only one contrasting colour for making particular items standout
- Styled social platform logos / Again, keeping the design of the site quite muted
- Responsive design / Built with the "mobile first" approach
