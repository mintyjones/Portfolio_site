          <h2>Auto Complacency</h2>
          <p>
            Sitting with my head in my hands, my stomach had sunk and the blood
            had drained from my face.
          </p>

          <p>My heart throbbed and I felt sick. Hours. Hours of work.</p>

          <p>Hours of work&#8230;just&#8230;gone.</p>

          <p>
            I wallowed for a while, but I was on company&rsquo;s time and I
            couldn&rsquo;t keep on wasting it, I&rsquo;d already wasted it by
            not saving my work.
          </p>

          <p>
            I mean, the computer blue screening wasn&rsquo;t my fault, but my
            complacent mindset was.
          </p>

          <p>
            Pulling myself together, I hastily grabbed a red marker and a piece
            of paper:
          </p>
          
          <img src="./imgs/blog_images/blog_2.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            That note stayed above my desk for many months to come until it
            became second nature for me to consistently save my files and muscle
            memory ensured that the habit stayed.
          </p>

          <p>
            We human grow very complacent, especially so in the developed world.
            A world where convenience is valued, but renders us reliant on
            certain things.
          </p>

          <p>
            So, while at a lesson today, it was pointed out that we could use
            the &ldquo;Autosave&rdquo; function in VS Code, alarm bells started
            ringing in my head. It&rsquo;s all well and good if you are only
            ever going to use VS Code as your IDE, but if you suddenly find
            yourself in a job where they dictate what IDE you are going to use,
            and in the off chance it doesn&rsquo;t have an autosave function,
            you are going to find yourself with a mindset that doesn&rsquo;t
            consider manual saving an imperative. Sooner or later, you will have
            to learn the hard way, like I did.
          </p>

          <p>
            Save manually, and save often, and it will save you heart-ache in
            the long run.
          </p>
