          <h2>Virtual Disarray</h2>
          <p><em>Posted: October 29 2020</em></p>
          <p>
            Do you have a tidy house, or apartment? Is your study desk littered
            with dirty dishes, empty cans and pieces of paper?
          </p>

          <p>
            It&rsquo;s nice to be house proud, and good for the mind to have a
            clean environment in which to live or work in.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is all well and good in the physical realm, but what happens if
            you had to invite a guest into your virtual privacy? Would your
            cleanliness and organisation extend there or is your OS&rsquo;s desk
            top hidden beneath piles of chaos?
          </p>

          <p>
            I bought a new (second-hand) laptop before I started my course and
            I&rsquo;ve set myself a task &mdash; to try and keep this computer
            as clean, tidy and organised as possible. Sounds simple? I&rsquo;m
            sure a lot of you, if you are anything like me, will shake your head
            and wish me good luck.
          </p>

          <p>
            With the exponential rise in virtual storage space over the last
            couple of decades, it becomes less and less of a factor to manage
            that space wisely, since it is so cheap to purchase more of this
            real estate.
          </p>

              Will there ever be enough space in the age of information?
            </figcaption>

          <p>
            I&rsquo;ve used computers for many years, personally, and at work
            and I consistently see mismanagement of drive space and file/folder
            structure and organisation. We&rsquo;re exposed to this phrase of
            being &ldquo;time-poor&rdquo;, but isn&rsquo;t that just a state of
            mind?
          </p>

          <p>
            My personal computer at home is chock-a-block full of drives &mdash;
            terabytes and terabytes of space, and my nature is just to keep
            filling it and filling it. And let&rsquo;s not mention the pile of
            old HDD&rsquo;s that are tucked away in a cupboard.
          </p>

          <p>
            Good intentions. I have them. But do I have the time? I&rsquo;d
            probably need at least a week of full-time work to tidy up my files
            but it&rsquo;s frustrating because I always have something
            &ldquo;better&rdquo; to do. If this same philosophy was applied to
            my living environment, I&rsquo;d have no room to move.
          </p>

          <p>
            Not only does this apply to files &mdash; images, pdf&rsquo;s,
            epubs, audio files, video files etc &mdash; but also to the amount
            of software that I have installed on my drives. This has never been
            so apparent to me as when I realised that I have to upgrade my
            computer from Win 7 to Win 10.
          </p>

          <p>I&rsquo;ve tried several times but keep hitting the same error:</p>

          <figure>
            <img src="./imgs/blog_images/blog_3B.jpg" alt="" />
            <figcaption>
              So near yet so far!
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            It seems that something is interfering with the install, but Windows
            decides that it&rsquo;s not going to tell you what. I have detached
            all external drives and hardware to no avail. It seems I have to
            start uninstalling software because something is not compatible.
          </p>

          <p>
            Alright, alright, I&rsquo;m ranting and getting off topic, but it is
            related. Years of installing software, sometimes unnecessarily, has
            resulted in my poor PC becoming ultimately bloated in every sense.
            Files, software, browser bookmarks &mdash; you name it, I&rsquo;ve
            force-fed my computer anything and everything &mdash; I&rsquo;m sure
            this is abuse in some shape or form.
          </p>

          <p>
            So, what to do? Sure, I can install some more software that will
            help me start tidying up my computer. How ironic.
          </p>

          <p>
            I just need to make the time &mdash; that&rsquo;s the only answer.
            But the other question nags me. Do I really need to address this
            issue? Well, if I ever want Windows 10 I&rsquo;ll need to do
            something.
          </p>

          <p>
            Moving forward, as I type on my svelte laptop, I&rsquo;ll try and
            keep my filing consistently ordered. When I download something, I
            try and put it in the appropriate folder. When I install a
            &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; program, I make a note in a text file I have
            as to what I&rsquo;m installing and when I&rsquo;m installing it so
            I have a breadcrumb trail. I&rsquo;ll question myself before
            installing an &ldquo;unnecessary&rdquo; program&rdquo;. When I
            don&rsquo;t need a file for ever, I&rsquo;ll try and remember to
            delete it. If I save a bookmark, I&rsquo;ll be sure to put it in a
            category that makes sense.
          </p>

          <p>
            It all comes down to planning, just like building a website or
            application. Write down your methods, what kind of file structure
            will suit you, what categories will work, then implement them
            accordingly.
          </p>

          <p>
            Then, schedule a regular audit of it all, to see if you are keeping
            on track, because that is the hardest thing of all, holding yourself
            to task. It&rsquo;s all well and good when you can see how untidy
            your kitchen or desktop is, there&rsquo;s only a finite amount of
            space, but in your virtual world, if you run out of acreage, you can
            just tack on some more.
          </p>

          <p>
            Treat your computer as if it were your home. Be proud to show
            someone around.
          </p>

          <p>Clean environment. Clean mind.</p>
